<h2 id="intro">Ascorbic Acid & Uric Acid Research</h2>

This is the ascorbic acid subsection of the Uric Acid and Vitamins section. So here you will find a list of studies that investigate links between vitamin C and gout.

For this current version, I have done a quick search of `ascorbic acid` and `gout` topics. Then, I've excluded studies that do not include a readily available abstract that summarizes a relevant connection. So there is scope for me to conduct more thorough research on specific aspects of ascorbic acid & uric acid if your feedback indicates I should.

Currently, the studies I have included are:

<h2 id="list">Your Ascorbic Acid & Uric Acid</h2>

Are you concerned about how your vitamin C consumption affects your gout? Then these are some studies that you should discuss with your professional health advisers. But, as you can see from the quotes, this is a complex topic. Since details from the studies show how results are affected by each gout sufferers individual circumstances. Especially with regard to each gout sufferers: 

- Uric acid production rates.
- Uric acid excretion rates.
- Other genetic and dietary factors.

So be sure to discuss suitable tests to ensure your uric acid treatment plan is safe and reliable. 

As ever, I prioritize completion of these studies according to your feedback. So if you want me to publish a review that is still not complete, let me know.
