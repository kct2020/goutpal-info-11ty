<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
As one of the winter squashes, butternut squash is a good source of vital nutrients. In fact, it scores a respectable 14 in the <a href="https://alkascore.com/powerhouse-fruits-vegetables-list/">Nutrient Density table for Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables</a>. But how do its rich nutrients affect uric acid?

<h2 id="butternut">{{ title }}</h2>
Unfortunately, I've been unable to find any research on butternut squash that mentions uric acid. However, this is the same for many popular foods. Because there is little incentive or funding available to research every food for the benefit of gout sufferers. So in cases like this, I look at the main nutrients or other properties of the food in question.

As mentioned, butternut squash provides many important nutrients. So here I've considered some. Elsewhere, I will look at fiber, potassium, etc.

<h3 id="carotene">Beta-carotene and Uric Acid</h3>
<p>During my early research into butternut squash and uric acid, I was reminded many times that it is a rich source of alpha- and beta-carotene. </p>
<code>Elmadfa, Rust, Majchrzak, Wagner, Genser, Lettner and Pinter, 2004. Effects of beta-carotene supplementation on free radical mechanism in healthy adult subjects. International journal for vitamin and nutrition research, 74(2), pp.147-152.</code>

<q cite="https://doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.74.2.147">Up to the end of supplementation, concentrations of uric acid decreased significantly in all intervention groups, independent of substitution dose.</q>

<h3 id="vita">Vitamin A and Uric Acid</h3>
<p>However, high vitamin A consumption is associated with increased uric acid. Whereas high beta-carotene consumption is associated with reduced uric acid.</p>
<code>Ford, E.S. and Choi, H.K., 2013. Associations between concentrations of uric acid with concentrations of vitamin A and beta-carotene among adults in the United States. Nutrition research, 33(12), pp.995-1002.</code>

<q cite="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2013.08.008">In conclusion, concentrations of vitamin A were positively and concentrations of beta-carotene were inversely associated with concentrations of uric acid. These results, if confirmed by experimental studies, possibly point to approaches to preventing elevated concentrations of uric acid.</q>

<h3 id="gout">Vitamin A and Gout</h3>
<p>As humans, we need sufficient vitamin A. But as gout sufferers, we must not overdo it…</p>
<code>Mawson, A.R. and Onor, G.I., 1991, April. Gout and vitamin A intoxication: is there a connection?. In Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism (Vol. 20, No. 5, pp. 297-304). WB Saunders.</code>

<q cite="https://doi.org/10.1016/0049-0172(91)90030-4">In what way could vitamin A metabolism be associated with the accepted connection between hyperuricemia and gout? Evidence suggests that purine and vitamin A metabolism are closely related processes. […] Hence, the common action of xanthine oxidase could result in elevated levels of uric acid and of retinoic acid due to: (A) increased dietary intake of retinol (eg, liver extract)</q>

<h2 id="next">Butternut Squash and Your Uric Acid</h2>
You have learned some facts about butternut squash. Especially, about two of it's key nutrients – vitamin A and beta-carotene. So you can use these facts in your discussions with health advisers about your butternut squash consumption.

Later, I will refer to these facts in my butternut squash articles for gout sufferers. E.g., <a href="https://goutpal.com/blog/beta-carotene-foods-gout/">Top Beta-Carotene Foods</a>. You can also discuss this research, and other {{ topic}} investigations <a href="https://links.goutpal.com/p/goutpal-links-gout-discussions?a=888958067">in the Gout Forum</a>.
