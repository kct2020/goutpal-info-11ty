Elderberries are an abundant natural product. With a long history of treating ailments in traditional medicine. But how does modern science assess the ability of elderberries to reduce uric acid?
<h2 id="pain">Elderberries and Gout Pain Relief</h2>
<p>During my review of uric acid studies, I noticed that elderberries have been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. So they may be useful during gout progression phase 3: Gout Pain Relief. However, I have limited this review to the effects of elderberries on uric acid.</p>
<h2 id="studies">Elderberries and Uric Acid Studies</h2>
<p>I found three studies that specifically include measurements of uric acid after elderberry treatment. However these uric acid results are incidental. Because these are not studies of gout patients. So if you and your doctor decide to include elderberries in your uric acid treatment, you must proceed cautiously. Because there are no human safety studies to verify effective doses.</p>
<h3 id="reduce">Elderberries Reduce Uric Acid</h3>
<p>This 2015 study reviews investigations into health benefits from elderberries. Including the uric acid reducing properties of elderberries. Therefore, elderberries might be of interest to gout patients who are starting their uric acid cure. If so, they should ask their doctor what elderberry products might support their main uric acid treatment.</p>
<p><code>Sidor, A. and Gramza-Michałowska, A., 2015. Advanced research on the antioxidant and health benefit of elderberry (Sambucus nigra) in food–a review. Journal of functional foods, 18, pp.941-958.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.07.012">Elderberry has medicinal properties associated with the presence of polyphenols, which are compounds with potential antioxidant properties. They can greatly affect the course of disease processes by counteracting oxidative stress, exerting beneficial effects on blood pressure, glycaemia reduction, immune system stimulation, antitumour potential, increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the blood plasma, including also glutathione, and the reduction of uric acid levels.</q></p>
<h3 id="juice">Elderberry Juice Does Not Change Uric Acid</h3>
<p>This 2005 report measured the effects of elderberry juice on antioxidant capacity. Also, the study monitored changes in uric acid levels. But found no change in blood uric acid after drinking elderberry juice. Which may be of interest to gout patients in the Adjust Uric Acid phase of gout progression. Because you might identify as one of the people who see no change in uric acid after drinking elderberry juice. </p>

<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2005.03.010">the
circulating levels of ascorbic acid and uric acid were measured. Both plasma antioxidants were unaffected by the
ingestion of elderberry juice or water</q></p>
<h3 id="freeze">Freeze-Dried Elderberries Reduce Uric Acid</h3>
<p>In this 2016 experiment, scientists poisoned groups of rats with cadmium (Cd) or lead (Pb) to artificially increase their uric acid. Then, some rats were fed with freeze-dried elderberry fruit (BEF). Resulting in reduced uric acid. Which may be of interest to gout patients in the Adjust Uric Acid phase of gout progression. Because this contrasts with the previous study. So results may depend on how elderberries are prepared for consumption.</p>

<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6117-3">We did find that the level of uric acid significantly decreased in the serum of rats fed with BEF + Cd and BEF +Pb diets compared with the animals fed the with C + Cd diet as well as C + Pb diets</q></p>

<h2 id="next">Elderberries and Your Uric Acid Research</h2>
If any of these elderberry studies seem relevant to your gout, then discuss them with your doctor. Because you need to apply the findings to your own medical history and aspirations.
