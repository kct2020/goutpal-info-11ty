<p>We can see from the 2020 ACR probenecid guidelines that probenecid is a recommended treatment for uric acid. So it definitely is a gout treatment. But my review of probenecid side effects research shows that it is much more than that. With potential applications in many diseases.</p>
<p>My approach to selecting gout treatments is to start with the 2020 ACR guidelines. Then also consider specific patient concerns. And research since 2020. So my approach here is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how the <a href="/blog/probenecid-research/">2020 ACR Probenecid Guidelines</a> affect you.</li>
<li>If you are concerned about side effects, check if any <a href="/blog/probenecid-side-effects/">Probenecid Side Effects Research Studies</a> are relevant to you.</li>
<li>If you have comorbidities, check if any recent research listed below is relevant to you.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recent">Probenecid Recent Research</h2>
<p>I found 5 probenecid studies since 2020. All of which mention its role as a uric acid treatment in gout. However, each study is mostly concerned with diseases other than gout.</p>
<h3 id="bone">Probenecid &amp; Bone Disease</h3>
<p>My first study investigates bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. </p>
<p><code>Cheng, M.H. and Kim, S.J., 2020. Inhibitory effect of probenecid on osteoclast formation via JNK, ROS and COX-2. Biomolecules &amp; Therapeutics, 28(1), p.104.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.4062/biomolther.2019.047">our results suggest that probenecid could potentially be used as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and rheumatic arthritis.</q></p>
<h3 id="birth">Probenecid and Near-Birth Heart Disease</h3>
<p>Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a potentially life-threatening disease. Where a mother's heart loses function between the last month of pregnancy and first few months of birth. </p>
<p><code>Onusko, E., McDermott, M.R., Robbins, N., Liu, G., Kranias, E.G., Rubinstein, J. and Koch, S.E., 2020. Probenecid treatment improves outcomes in a novel mouse model of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Plos one, 15(3), p.e0230386.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230386">probenecid improves survival in a novel mouse model of PPCM by improving contractility and reducing LV (left ventricular) remodeling</q></p>
<h3 id="heart">Probenecid &amp; Heart Function</h3>
<p>This laboratory study explains some new facts about how probenecid might improve heart functions.</p>
<p><code>Rubinstein, J., Woo, J.G., Garcia, A.M., Alsaied, T., Li, J., Lunde, P.K., Moore, R.A., Laasmaa, M., Sammons, A., Mays, W.A. and Miyamoto, S.D., 2020. Probenecid improves cardiac function in subjects with a fontan circulation and augments cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. Pediatric Cardiology, 41(8), pp.1675-1688.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-020-02427-7">the information provided by this study can educate future studies that may seek to personalize the dosing and timing of probenecid therapy based on degree of disease progression</q></p>
<h3 id="uric">Probenecid &amp; Uric Acid</h3>
<p>This study explains how probenecid singles out uric acid for excretion. While encouraging increased levels of other potentially beneficial substances.</p>
<p><code>Granados, J.C., Bhatnagar, V. and Nigam, S.K., 2022. Blockade of organic anion transport in humans after treatment with the drug probenecid leads to major metabolic alterations in plasma and urine. Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2630">97 metabolites that were significantly elevated in the plasma and decreased in the urine, indicating OAT-mediated clearance. These included signaling molecules, antioxidants, and gut microbiome products. In contrast, urate was the only metabolite significantly decreased in the plasma and elevated in the urine</q></p>
<h3 id="kidney">Probenecid &amp; Kidney Injury</h3>
<p>My final study investigates probenecid as a potential treatment for kidney injury. Because it has been shown to protect against brain and heart diseases.</p>
<p><code>El-Maadawy, W.H., Hassan, M., Badawy, M.H., AbuSeada, A. and Hafiz, E., 2022. Probenecid induces the recovery of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury via the blockade of Pannexin 1/P2X7 receptor axis. Life Sciences, 308, p.120933.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120933">Our study elaborates for the first time the effectiveness of PBN [probenecid] in recovering post-ischemic renal injury [RI] […]  Therefore, PBN can be considered a promising drug for RI/RI treatment.</q></p>
<h2 id="trials">Probenecid Clinical Trials</h2>
<p>Clinical trials are a precursor to the most relevant probenecid research. So with 55 trials at the time of writing. We might expect some interesting new developments for gout treatment. However, only 1 of the 55 trials involves gout patients. And even that study is designed to measure the effects of probenecid on dementia.</p>
<p><code>Rishi J. Desai, 2021. Data Analysis for Drug Repurposing for Effective Alzheimer's Medicines- Probenecid vs Allopurinol. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04746989</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04746989">This study aims to evaluate the comparative risk of dementia/Alzheimer's disease onset between patients treated with medications that target specific metabolic pathways and patients treated with alternative medications for the same indication using healthcare claims data.</q></p>
<p>The other probenecid clinical trials cover many diseases. Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol use disorder</li>
<li>Bacterial infection</li>
<li>Cellulitis</li>
<li>COVID-19</li>
<li>CPPD - Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Heart failure</li>
<li>HIV Infections</li>
<li>Influenza</li>
<li>Morphine dependence</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Syphilis</li>
<li>Urinary Tract Infections</li>
</ul>
