##Gout Library Status

I have moved the 2020 version of my gout library to a new platform. Hence we currently have an <a href="/goutpal-info-wp-2020">old library</a> and this new blog. Next I'll add new content to this blog. Then I'll gradually review the old content and republish it here, if it's still relevant.

This new platform allows me to rapidly expand the number of scientific reviews. Especially those that affect you most. Because it is now much easier to collaborate on issues that concern you. So I can prioritize my research accordingly.

In particular, I will focus on the responsibilities of gout sufferers as described in the latest professional guidelines and associated reports.

## Your Gout Library

I hope you'll read my reviews of gout science and discuss them with your health professionals. Also, I hope you'll tell me if you want clarification. Or if you want me to review a gout study that I haven't included.

First, check to see if we are already discussing your concerns in <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/goutpal-info-11ty/issues">Gout Library Issues</a>. If not, <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/goutpal-info-11ty/issues/new/choose">raise a new issue</a> to share your questions, experiences, and opinions.
