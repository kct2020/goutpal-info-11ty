<p>Raisins are popular as a fruity snack. Or as an ingredient in cold breakfast cereals, and warm pies and cakes. But how many raisins should gout sufferers consume?</p>
<h2 id="raisinuricacidresearchtopics">Raisin &amp; Uric Acid Research Topics</h2>
<p>Here are my brief summaries of three investigations into how raisin consumption affects uric acid levels.</p>
<h3 id="lower">Raisin Extract May Lower Uric Acid</h3>
<p>Researchers prepared a raisin extract called "Karkni". By soaking ground raisins in water. After 2 weeks, low and moderate doses reduced uric acid in rats. But the highest dose was least effective. </p>
<p><code>Ghrairi, F., Amira, E.A., Henda, C., Lahouar, L., Achour, L. and Said, S., 2012. Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of raisin aqueous extract ‚ÄúKarkni‚Äù in Alloxan-induced diabetic rats. J Diabetes Metab, 3(8), p.217.</code></p>
<q cite="https://doi.org/10.4172/2155-6156.1000217">In our study, ‚ÄúKarkni‚Äù extract showed a significant decrease in levels of uric acid in (D+C1) and (D+C2) groups when compared with those of diabetic control. But it was still remaining higher in (D+C3) group</q>
<h3 id="increase">High Raisin Intake Increases Uric Acid</h3>
<p>Human volunteers consumed about 5 oz (144 g) Corinthian raisins (described as "an acute amount"). Then researchers measured uric acid in their blood at hourly intervals.</p>
<p><code>Kanellos, P.T., Kaliora, A.C., Gioxari, A., Christopoulou, G.O., Kalogeropoulos, N. and Karathanos, V.T., 2013. Absorption and bioavailability of antioxidant phytochemicals and increase of serum oxidation resistance in healthy subjects following supplementation with raisins. Plant foods for human nutrition, 68(4), pp.411-415.</code>
</p>
<q cite="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-013-0389-2"> To check the existence of confounding effect from uric acid, we measured the levels of serum uric acid before and 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after raisin supplementation. The increase in uric acid occurred 3 and 4 h following ingestion, but not at peak time of serum resistance, namely 1 h after ingestion</q>
<h3 id="notchange">Moderate Raisin Intake Does Not Change Uric Acid</h3>
<p>Human diabetics were separated into groups of raisin eaters and abstainers. For 24 weeks, the raisin eating group consumed 1¬º oz (36 g) per day of Corinthian raisins.</p>
<p><code>Kanellos, P.T., Kaliora, A.C., Tentolouris, N.K., Argiana, V., Perrea, D., Kalogeropoulos, N., Kountouri, A.M. and Karathanos, V.T., 2014. A pilot, randomized controlled trial to examine the health outcomes of raisin consumption in patients with diabetes. Nutrition, 30(3), pp.358-364.</code>
