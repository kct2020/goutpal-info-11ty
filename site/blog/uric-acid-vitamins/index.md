<h2 id="intro">Uric Acid & Vitamins Introduction</h2>

The main groups of vitamins associated with gout are vitamins B and C. So I've created subsections in this Uric Acid & Vitamins section for <a href="/blog/ascorbic-acid-gout/">Ascorbic Acid & Uric Acid</a> and <a href="/blog/vitamin-b-uric-acid/">Vitamin B and Uric Acid</a>.

So far, I haven't found any meaningful uric acid studies for tocopherol (vitamin E) or phytomenadione (vitamin K). But here are some for retinol (vitamin A) and calciferol (vitamin D).

Are you concerned about how your vitamins consumption affects your gout? Then these are some studies that you should discuss with your professional health advisers. But, as you can see from the quotes, this is a complex topic. Since details from the studies show how results are affected by each gout sufferers individual circumstances. Especially with regard to each gout sufferers genetics and comorbidities. So be sure to discuss and arrange suitable tests to ensure your uric acid treatment plan is safe and reliable. 

I prioritize completion of these studies according to your feedback. So if you want me to publish a review that is still not complete, let me know. Then I can change my priorities according to your needs.
