<h2 id="intro">Vitamin B & Uric Acid Introduction</h2>
This is the vitamin B subsection of the <a href="/blog/uric-acid-vitamins/">Uric Acid & Vitamins</a> section. So here you will find a list of studies that investigate links between gout and...

- Vitamin B₁ (thiamine)
- Vitamin B₂ (riboflavin)
- Vitamin B₃ (niacin)
- Vitamin B₅ (pantothenic acid)
- Vitamin B₆ (pyridoxine)
- Vitamin B₇ (biotin)
- Vitamin B₉ (folic acid or folate)
- Vitamin B₁₂ (cobalamins)

For this current version, I have done a quick search of `uric acid` and `vitamin B` topics. So there is scope for me to conduct more thorough research if your feedback indicates I should. For example, I might focus on specific types of B vitamin & uric acid

In WENBIT [Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial], folic acid supplementation had neither an effect on the risk of cardiovascular events (4) nor on plasma uric acid concentrations. This suggests that folic acid cannot solve the problem of hyperuricemia and its relation to excess cardiovascular risk.</q></td>
