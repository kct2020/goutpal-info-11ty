    <div class="kctdisclaimer text-300">Medical Disclaimer: The <a href="https://www.goutpal.com/gouty/purpose/">purpose of GoutPal</a> is to provide jargon-free explanations of medical gout-related terms and procedures. Because gout sufferers need to know what questions to ask their doctor. Also, you need to understand what your doctor tells you. So this website explains gout science. But it is definitely NOT a substitute for medical advice. <p>Information on this website is provided by a fellow gout sufferer (<a href="https://keith-taylor.pages.dev/">Keith Taylor</a>) with an accountant's precision for accurate data. But no medical qualifications. So you must seek professional medical advice about gout and any other health matters. </p>
